                <h1 class="heading3">C Programming:</h1>
                <div class="content3">
                    <p>I had some previous knowledge in C++ since I started trying to learn it from YouTube over the summer,
                      so C programming seemed a little easier to learn in Sem 2. </p>
                    <p>Even so, not knowing much about coding, it was a little tough to figure my way out through things 
                        like nested for loops in the beginning, but by the end of the semester, CP became the easiest subject 
                        of the semester for me. Problem solving is quite fun once I understand the syntax and basic logic.
                    </p>
                    <p>All in all, I'd say C programming is chill. Once I got the hang of it, it went by pretty easily.
                        I hope my experience with learning coding will be somewhat similar and fun just like C was.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <!-- Python Programming -->
                <h1 class="heading3">Python Programming:</h1>
                <div class="content3">
                    <p>
                        I started learning Python for Machine Learning Tasks *wink wink* and boy was it fun. 
                        I watched a 4-5 hour long YouTube tutorial one day and learnt all the basics. After learning C, 
                        Python's simple sytnax just makes more sense. Applying logic and figuring out how to execute different functions, 
                        all of it makes the wheels in my brain turn. Ah, this is why I'm trying to be an engineer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I do have a lot to learn in Python with its bazillion libraries. I'm pretty excited to know more honestly. 
                        AI/ML sounds like the most interesting thing in our future, and from the little I've managed to learn in the past 
                        couple of weeks, it might just be. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've always wondered how a lot of things work and how many computer features are built, so this feels like the way to go for me.

                    <p>
                        Okay so this is my first web dev project lol. This is what I achieved in literally 1 day. 
                        If I had given myself more time, it looks like web dev could be very interesting. There's a lot 
                        you can do and a lot to learn. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'd say I am a very creative person, so CSS is quite interesting for someone like me, thought it is 
                        a little frustrating to figure out all the alignments and stuff. Honestly, I have a lot to learn in this 
                        department, and I can't wait to get to it.

                <p>
                    Music is my first love. I started singing with cartoon theme songs when I was two years old.
                    Through all the growing up I have done in my life, my love for singing has always been with me.
                    If it wasn't engineering, and if we lived in a ideal world where arts could be seriously persued, 
                    this is what I would want to do with my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also play the guitar, I learnt it mainly for singing along, and because a music teacher once told me 
                    that you can't consider yourself a musician unless you can sing, play an instrument and understand music theory.
                    I also needed it to be able to write songs to, yep, I'm also a songwriter, or trying to be one anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have way too many favourite artists lol, but if I had to name one 
                </p>
                <p> Taylor Swift</p>
                <p>Hands down the best songwriter of our generation. Some say she *is* the music industry.</p>
                <p>She is my biggest inspiration</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Art -->
            <h1 class="heading3">Art:</h1>
            <div class="content3">
                <p>
                    I love learning new things, I think that's what life is about. So in the two years of lockdown
                    I learnt a lot of creative stuff in my free time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like knitting, crocheting, sewing, embroidery,etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides that I also enjoy the usual doodling, painting, drawing on my hands stuff. Art is 
                    just very peaceful and random. It gives you freedom to do whatever you can come up with, and I think that's pretty cool.
